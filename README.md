### About me
> 🙋🏻‍♀️ Hi, I'm Gyumin. <br>
> 🍛 It's like cumin, but with a softer c sound. <br>
> 😏 I also go by 'Q', if that works better for you. <br>
> 📍 Based in Seoul, South Korea. <br>
> 🔠 I speak `Korean`, `English`, and `Spanish`(👶-level). <br>
> 💻 I also speak machine languages: `JavaScript`, `Python`, and baby-level `Java`. <br>
> 📚 I believe in the power of consistency... now digging into `Data analysis`. <br>
> 🌎 My passion for traveling has made me a better human being, with various perspectives on the world. <br>
> 👥 I love meeting new people & listening to their stories! <br>
> 🍜 Food enthusiast. Protein keeps me healthy, and carbs make me happy. <br>
> 🧗🏻‍♀️ I boulder my way through life, problem by problem. <br>
